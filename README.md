## DTF - Discord Tag Finder
`DTF` is a tool that utilizes `Discord's user API` to send friend request to all users with the same username. This works by sending friend requests to the desired username with every tag combination from 1-9999. This repo contains 4 python files. old.py is deprecated, multi-normal.py and normal.py are the same by the time formula and multi-thread.py utilizes threading in python to cunt the worst estimated time by the numbers of separated processes.
